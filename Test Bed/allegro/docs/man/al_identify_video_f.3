.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tries to guess the video file type of the open ALLEGRO_FILE by reading
the first few bytes.
By default Allegro cannot recognize any file types, but calling
al_init_video_addon(3) will add detection of the types it can read.
.PP
Returns a pointer to a static string with a file extension for the type,
including the leading dot.
For example \[lq].ogv\[rq].
Returns NULL if the video type cannot be determined.
