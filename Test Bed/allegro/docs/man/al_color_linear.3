#include <allegro5/allegro_color.h>

ALLEGRO_COLOR al_color_linear(float r, float g, float b)
\f[R]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Return an ALLEGRO_COLOR(3) structure from linear sRGB values.
Allegro RGB values are assumed to be sRGB.
The sRGB standard is in wide use by various display devices.
It accounts for a standard gamma correction applied to RGB colors before
they get displayed.
.PP
Gamma correction means if for example we have a medium gray color
specified with al_map_rgb_f(0.5,0.5,0.5) then we do not want the monitor
to set the pixel to exactly half the physical maximum intensity, but
instead to an intensity that appears to be half as bright as the maximum
to the person looking at it.
In this case that would be closer to 21% of maximum intensity rather
than to 50% intensity.
.PP
For some applications it may be useful to specify a color in linear sRGB
components, in which case you can use this function.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
ALLEGRO_COLOR gray = al_color_linear(0.216, 0.216, 0.216);
char html[8];
al_color_rgb_to_html(gray.r, gray.g, gray.b, html); // \[dq]#808080\[dq]
